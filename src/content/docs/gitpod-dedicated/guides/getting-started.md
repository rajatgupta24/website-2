title: Getting Started with Gitpod Dedicated - Gitpod Dedicated docs
---

# Getting Started

> ℹ️ You will need to have familiarity with AWS, specifically CloudFormation, in order to be able to execute this guide.

Currently, Gitpod Dedicated is only available in the following AWS regions:

-   `us-east-1`
-   `us-east-2`
-   `us-west-2`
-   `ap-northeast-1`
-   `ap-southeast-2`
-   `eu-west-1`
-   `eu-central-1`

## 1. Set up an AWS Account for Gitpod Dedicated

> ℹ️ Gitpod Dedicated is expected to run in its own independent AWS account. It is not intended to run alongside other components in a shared or existing AWS account.

Create a new AWS account following the steps in [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html). Start by navigating to the AWS console and creating the account as part of the customer’s AWS organization.

1. Ensure that the account has at least the following quotas for the region where Gitpod Dedicated will be deployed into. Note that quote increases can take anywhere between one hour and days.

|                  Service                  |                               Name                               | Value |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :---------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------: | :---: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) |                       EC2-VPC Elastic IPs                        |  20   | Gitpod requires 3 IP addresses for each load balancer (Gitpod has 2 load balancers, one for meta and one for the workspace cluster). Additionally, 3 IPs are needed for each NAT gateway (Gitpod has 3 VPCs, so 3x). Therefore, at a minimum, 15 IPs are needed. The additional 5 act as a buffer in case a new load balancer needs to be provisioned and runs in parallel to the old one, ensuring a smooth transition. For more information, please see [Architecture](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/reference/architecture). |
| Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) | Running On-Demand Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) Instances |  256  |                                                                                                                                                                                   The value depends on the number of developers use the instance. This is the bare minimum Gitpod recommends. More workspaces require a higher quota.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                AWS Lambda                 |                      Concurrent Executions                       | 1024  |                                                                                                      To ensure Gitpod can install and operate properly, the default concurrent execution quota should be increased to 1024. The default quota is usually 1000, but it can sometimes be as low as 10 due to unknown AWS-related reasons. Increasing the quota to 1024 guarantees that Gitpod will function properly.                                                                                                      |
| Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) |                         VPCs per Region                          |   4   |                                                                                                                                Technically Gitpod only uses 1 VPCs. If the account comes with a default VPC, this already results in 2 required. The rest of this quota is a buffer in case additional VPCs need to be created for private networking (e.g. landing zone) - this is TBD.                                                                                                                                 |

2. Ensure that you allow for cross-account and cross-region communication with `eu-central-1`. For example, this could be restricted by [SCPs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) such as a [Region deny SCP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/region-deny.html). To roll out updates to the application, an AWS Lambda function pulls several configurations from a known S3 bucket owned by Gitpod. This bucket is hosted in the Gitpod Dedicated control plane located in the `eu-central-1` region.

## 2. Execute two CloudFormation templates in the new account to bootstrap the infrastructure and install Gitpod Dedicated

> ℹ️ Feel free to notify your Gitpod account manager if you require a preview of the CloudFormation template in order to better understand what will be deployed in your account. If necessary, share it with other team’s in your company that need to review it. Please see [AWS IAM permission requirements](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/reference/AWS-IAM-permission-requirements) for information on the permissions needed.

The process for creating the necessary infrastructure in the customer’s account and installing Gitpod Dedicated onto it is as follows:

1. **Provide information**: A Gitpod account manager will ask for information needed to generate the CloudFormation template that will be used to bootstrap the infrastructure for your Gitpod instance. See [Networking and Data flows](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/reference/networking-data-flows) for general guidance and requirements on which services Gitpod needs to be able to route to. <br/>The information required depends on the choice of networking mode:

<details class="ml-4">

<summary class="text-body text-p-medium mt-micro">All Private Networking Mode</summary>

1. `Subdomain` of your Gitpdod installation. The full domain will be `<subdomain>.gitpod.cloud` unless a custom domain is used (see below).

<details class="ml-8">

<summary class="text-body text-p-medium mt-micro">Please note:</summary>

Depending on your compliance and regulatory requirements, you may want to avoid including your company name in the URL. Although efforts are taken to minimize any exposure, avoiding using the company name can further increase confidentiality and reduce exposure risk.

</details>

2. `AWS account ID` of the account created above, in which Gitpod will be installed into.
3. `AWS region` in which Gitpod will be installed. See [a](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/guides/getting-started#:~:text=Currently%2C%20Gitpod%20Dedicated%20is%20only%20available%20in%20the%20following%20AWS%20regions%3A)bove for available regions.
4. `Relay CIDR range`: This is the small part of the VPC of the Gitpod instance that needs to be routable from your network. This part is called the relay subnet and it contains the NATs and attaches to your Transit Gateway (see below). See [Networking and Data flows](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/reference/networking-data-flows) for more details and a networking diagram.

<details class="ml-8">

<summary class="text-body text-p-medium mt-micro">Please consider the following points when choosing this range:</summary>

-   The only restriction in place is that the `Relay CIDR range` must be `/25` and not in the range `100.64.0.0/10` (the parent range used by Gitpod).
-   The chosen `Relay CIDR range` must not overlap with any services you wish to route to or from Gitpod, e.g. your source code repository, SSO provider or package repositories.
-   [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) will not be triggered automatically if your Source Control Management system (e.g. GitHub) cannot send web hooks to the Gitpod instance, i.e. is able to route to this CIDR range.

</details>

5. `transitGatewayID` of the Transit Gateway you want your Gitpod instance’s VPC to connect (attach) to. All traffic that is not going to the Dedicated Control Plane will be routed through a newly created transit gateway attachment attached to the Transit Gateway with this ID. See [Networking and Data flows](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/reference/networking-data-flows) for more information.

<details class="ml-8">

<summary class="text-body text-p-medium mt-micro">Please note: </summary>

When using auto-propagation by default, delete the propagation from your Transit Gateway Routetable associated with the Gitpod Transit Gateway Attachment and replace it with a static route pointing the `Relay CIDR range` (`/25`) to the Gitpod Transit Gateway Attachment ID. This ensures only the required relay range is shared on your Transit Gateway network and no other routes are accidentally broadcast.

</details>

6. `expose public services` : This is an option at the customer’s discretion (takes a value of `true` or `false`). An API Gateway is added to expose endpoints for webhooks (required for prebuilds, e.g. Gitlab.com, to allow webhooks to be forwarded to internal Gitpod services) and IDP services (required to enable the use of public [OIDC IDPs within workspaces](/docs/configure/workspaces/oidc)) to the public internet. The added API gateway enables these features without:
    - Exposing the entire instance to the public internet
    - Extra effort to add public ingress within the customer’s network behind the transit gateway.

</details>

<details class="ml-4">

<summary class="text-body text-p-medium mt-micro">Mixed with Private Ingress Networking Mode</summary>

1. Subdomain of your Gitpdod installation. The full domain will be `<subdomain>.gitpod.cloud` unless a custom domain is used (see below).

2. `AWS account ID` of the account created above, in which Gitpod will be installed into.
3. `AWS region` in which Gitpod will be installed. See [a](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/guides/getting-started#:~:text=Currently%2C%20Gitpod%20Dedicated%20is%20only%20available%20in%20the%20following%20AWS%20regions%3A)bove for available regions.
4. `CIDR range of your network`, i.e. the IP address space used by your company network that you want workspaces to be able to route to. At the very least, provide the relevant ranges that you want Gitpod to be able to interact with. This helps Gitpod ensure there are no possible IP conflicts with CIDR ranges used internally in the Gitpod instance (`100.70.0.0/16`, part of CGNAT range). Note that this internal Gitpod range does not need to be routable from your network. For more information on Gitpod’s networking setup, please refer to [Networking and Data flows](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/reference/networking-data-flows) for a networking diagram.

<details class="ml-8">
<summary class="text-body text-p-medium">FAQ</summary>

-   If the Gitpod internal range of `100.70.0.0/16` does not need to be routable from my network, why do we need to specify the `CIDR range of our network`?
    -   User workspaces traffic must cross this range when reaching the rest of your network. If there are common internal services and systems that developers may need to access that overlap with this range, the experience may be inconsistent and difficult to troubleshoot. To avoid this, Gitpod can adapt the internally used CIDR range for workspaces to the customer’s CIDR range.
-   What if the `100.70.0.0/16` range overlaps with my network? - Please contact your Gitpod account manager. There is some flexibility to the CIDR range used internally by Gitpod.

The information required further depends on whether the choice of using an allowlist and custom domain:

<details class="ml-4">

<summary class="text-body text-p-medium mt-micro">When using an Allowlist</summary>

The allowlist will apply to all inbound traffic to the Gitpod Dedicated Instance. In addition to the above, the following information is required:

-   `allowlist` of IPs or CIDR ranges that should be allowed to access the instance. Any CIDRs provided in the `CIDR range of your network` above are always allowed. Example:

    ```
    allowListIPs:
        - 32.45.67.4/32

2. **Receive Two CloudFormation templates:** You will need to execute two CloudFormation templates to install the infrastructure and subsequently Gitpod Dedicated. The `infrastructure-creation-role-template.json` (downloadable below) is used to create an IAM role that is assumed during the execution of the subsequent `<customer>-gitpod-template.json` CloudFormation template (shared with you by your Gitpod Account manager). The `<customer>-gitpod-template.json` CloudFormation template installs the infrastructure for Gitpod Dedicated.

<details class="ml-4">

<summary class="text-body text-p-medium my-micro">FAQ</summary>

-   Why two templates?
    -   The `infrastructure-creation-role-template.json` CloudFormation template is used to create a role that has a minimum of permissions, yet allows for a predictable outcome when executing `<customer>-gitpod-template.json`. Further, it provides more transparency to the customer.
-   Can the stack created by `infrastructure-creation-role-template.json` be deleted after executing the `<customer>-gitpod-template.json` ?
    -   No, the stack created by `infrastructure-creation-role-template.json` should be maintained. The role created is also used when updates are provided to the `<customer>-gitpod-template.jsonn` template. For more details on infrastructure updates, please see [Deployment and Updates](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/background/deployment-updates).

</details>

3. **Execute CloudFormation templates**

    > ⚠️ Do not modify the CloudFormation templates outside of adding AWS resource tags. Doing so will result in the installation failing.

<div class="ml-6">

1.  First, download and execute the `infrastructure-creation-role-template.json` template in the new AWS account created above: <br/>

</details>

<details class="ml-8 mt-macro">

<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

In the rare case that the template has an error during execution, it is advised to remove all existing resources before trying again. See [Deleting your Gitpod installation](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/guides/deleting-your-gitpod-installation).

</details>

2.  Then, execute `<customer>-gitpod-template.json` that will be shared by your Gitpod account manager in the same AWS account. This will create the infrastructure that Gitpod Dedicated requires.

> ℹ️ During the “configure stack options” step, select the role created by the first CloudFormation template (`GitpodSetupAndInitialEKSUserAdmin`) as the role used for permissions. Depending on timing, you may need to manually select the role using its ARN. Again, select the “roll back all the stack resources” option.

## 3. Setup Gitpod

Gitpod is now ready to be setup. Your Gitpod account manager will provide the URL to access it. This URL will contain a one time admin password. This is used to authenticate when no Single Sign-On (SSO) has been set up yet.

You are three steps away from launching your first Gitpod workspace:

<summary class="text-body text-medium mt-micro font-bold">Add a SCM integration for GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket</summary>

<div class="ml-2 mt-micro">

Integrate it with your SCM as per the steps shown in the UI or below. You can now create your first workspace and start using Gitpod! For more information on how to use Gitpod, please see the [Getting Started guide of Gitpod](/docs/introduction/getting-started).

-   Look at [these steps](/docs/configure/authentication/gitlab#registering-a-self-hosted-gitlab-installation) for information on how to integrate [`GitLab.com`](https://gitlab.com/) with your Gitpod instance. You will need to enter `gitlab.com` as the `Provider Host Name` in the New Git Integration Modal if you want to use gitlab.com, contrary to what is described.
-   Look at these [these steps](/docs/configure/authentication/github-enterprise) for information on how to integrate [`GitHub.com`](http://github.com/) with your Gitpod instance. You will need to enter `github.com` as the `Provider Host Name` in the New Git Integration Modal if you want to use github.com, contrary to what is described.
-   Look at [these steps](/docs/configure/authentication/bitbucket-server) for information on how to integrate [`Bitbucket Server`](https://www.atlassian.com/de/software/bitbucket/enterprise) with your Gitpod instance. Select `Bitbucket Server` as the `Provider Type` in the New Git Integration Modal. For bitbucket.org this requires configuring an “OAuth consumer” on a “workspace”. This is slightly different from the documented Bitbucket Server integration. See [gitpod PR #9894](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/9894#pullrequestreview-969013833) for an example.

> ℹ️ The first workspace start(s) will take longer than usual, sometimes exceeding 10 minutes depending on the workspace image used. This is because an image first needs to be built, a node needs to be spun up, and that image then downloaded to the node. However, subsequent workspace starts will be significantly faster.
